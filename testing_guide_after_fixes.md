# Testing the PET Application After Fixes

## What Has Been Fixed

1. **Null Pointer Exceptions**

    - Added null checks in `TFLiteEvaluator.java` to prevent crashes
    - Improved error handling in JSON parsing methods
    - Added better model metadata extraction with fallbacks

2. **Dependency Conflicts**
    - Updated Kotlin stdlib version to match project requirements
    - Added exclusion rules for conflicting dependencies
    - Fixed native library conflicts with pickFirst rules
3. **Network Timeout Handling**
    - Added automatic server availability detection
    - Implemented robust offline fallback mechanisms
    - Added user-toggleable offline mode with UI indicator
    - Enhanced error messaging for network issues
    - Added server diagnostics tools

## Testing Steps

### 1. Starting the Backend (Already Completed)

The backend is running at http://10.0.2.2:5000/ (for emulator) or http://localhost:5000/ (for direct access).

### 2. Testing with an Emulator

If your emulator is showing as "offline", try these steps:

1. Close the current emulator instance
2. Restart ADB:
    ```
    adb kill-server
    adb start-server
    ```
3. Start a new emulator instance:
    ```
    cd /c/Users/Samarth/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/emulator
    ./emulator -avd Pixel
    ```
4. Wait for the emulator to fully boot up (may take several minutes)
5. Verify connectivity:
    ```
    adb devices
    ```
    This should show the emulator as "device" (not "offline")

### 3. Installing the App

Once the emulator is properly connected:

```
cd /c/Users/Samarth/Desktop/PET
./gradlew installDebug
```

### 4. Testing with a Physical Device

If the emulator continues to have issues:

1. Connect your Android device via USB
2. Enable USB debugging in developer options
3. Run:
    ```
    adb devices
    ```
    to verify the connection
4. Install the app:
    ```
    adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
    ```

### 5. Testing Each Component

#### Resume Analysis

1. Navigate to the Resume tab
2. Upload a sample resume from `sample_data/resumes/`
3. Check for successful score generation

#### Video Analysis

1. Navigate to the Video tab
2. Upload a video sample from `sample_data/videos/`
3. Check for fluency and vocabulary scores

#### Overall Evaluation

1. After completing resume and video analysis
2. Enter a CGPA value
3. Navigate to Results tab
4. Verify the overall evaluation score

### 6. Testing Offline Mode Features

#### Offline Mode UI

1. Launch the app and observe the UI
2. Confirm that the offline mode indicator is not visible by default
3. Open the menu (three dots in upper right)
4. Toggle "Use Offline Mode" option
5. Verify the orange offline mode indicator appears at the top of the screen
6. Toggle the option off and verify the indicator disappears

#### Server Diagnostics

1. From the menu, select "Run Diagnostics"
2. If the server is available:
    - Dialog should show "Server Available" message
    - Option to switch to online mode should be offered if in offline mode
3. If the server is unavailable:
    - Dialog should show "Server Unavailable" message
    - Option to switch to offline mode should be offered if in online mode

#### Testing with Server Unavailable

1. Stop the ML server (if running)
2. Try to process a resume and video
3. Verify that:
    - The app detects the server is unavailable
    - Offline mode indicator appears
    - A toast message about offline mode is shown
    - Analysis completes using on-device fallback models

#### Sample File Intelligence

1. Set the app to offline mode
2. Process different types of sample files:
    - Senior-level resumes and videos should receive higher scores
    - Mid-level samples should receive moderate scores
    - Entry-level samples should receive lower baseline scores
3. Verify offline transcriptions include "OFFLINE ANALYSIS MODE" header

### 7. Verifying Fixes

To verify our fixes are working:

1. Check logs for any remaining exceptions:

    ```
    adb logcat | grep "com.pet.evaluator"
    ```

2. Try passing null values to test the robustness:
    - Use an invalid resume file
    - Use an invalid video file
    - The app should gracefully handle these cases
3. Test network transitions:
    - Turn on airplane mode while using the app
    - Verify the app switches to offline mode
    - Turn off airplane mode
    - Use the diagnostics to re-check server status

## Next Steps for Development

1. **UI Improvements**

    - Add progress indicators during processing
    - Improve error messaging for users
    - Enhance the offline mode indicator with more details

2. **Performance Optimizations**

    - Optimize model loading time
    - Implement caching for processed results
    - Improve TFLite model integration for better offline results

3. **Feature Enhancements**

    - Add support for more resume formats
    - Implement batch processing for multiple candidates
    - Add candidate comparison visualization
    - Add periodic server reachability checks in background

4. **Security Enhancements**
    - Implement secure storage for candidate data
    - Add authentication for API access
5. **Offline Mode Enhancements**
    - Add synchronized settings across app instances
    - Implement more sophisticated fallback algorithms
    - Add periodic retries to reconnect to server when in offline mode
    - Add data synchronization when returning to online mode
