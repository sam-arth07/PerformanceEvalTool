# Testing the PET Application After Fixes

## What Has Been Fixed

1. **Null Pointer Exceptions**

    - Added null checks in `TFLiteEvaluator.java` to prevent crashes
    - Improved error handling in JSON parsing methods
    - Added better model metadata extraction with fallbacks

2. **Dependency Conflicts**
    - Updated Kotlin stdlib version to match project requirements
    - Added exclusion rules for conflicting dependencies
    - Fixed native library conflicts with pickFirst rules

## Testing Steps

### 1. Starting the Backend (Already Completed)

The backend is running at http://10.0.2.2:5000/ (for emulator) or http://localhost:5000/ (for direct access).

### 2. Testing with an Emulator

If your emulator is showing as "offline", try these steps:

1. Close the current emulator instance
2. Restart ADB:
    ```
    adb kill-server
    adb start-server
    ```
3. Start a new emulator instance:
    ```
    cd /c/Users/Samarth/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/emulator
    ./emulator -avd Pixel
    ```
4. Wait for the emulator to fully boot up (may take several minutes)
5. Verify connectivity:
    ```
    adb devices
    ```
    This should show the emulator as "device" (not "offline")

### 3. Installing the App

Once the emulator is properly connected:

```
cd /c/Users/Samarth/Desktop/PET
./gradlew installDebug
```

### 4. Testing with a Physical Device

If the emulator continues to have issues:

1. Connect your Android device via USB
2. Enable USB debugging in developer options
3. Run:
    ```
    adb devices
    ```
    to verify the connection
4. Install the app:
    ```
    adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
    ```

### 5. Testing Each Component

#### Resume Analysis

1. Navigate to the Resume tab
2. Upload a sample resume from `sample_data/resumes/`
3. Check for successful score generation

#### Video Analysis

1. Navigate to the Video tab
2. Upload a video sample from `sample_data/videos/`
3. Check for fluency and vocabulary scores

#### Overall Evaluation

1. After completing resume and video analysis
2. Enter a CGPA value
3. Navigate to Results tab
4. Verify the overall evaluation score

### 6. Verifying Fixes

To verify our fixes are working:

1. Check logs for any remaining exceptions:

    ```
    adb logcat | grep "com.pet.evaluator"
    ```

2. Try passing null values to test the robustness:
    - Use an invalid resume file
    - Use an invalid video file
    - The app should gracefully handle these cases

## Next Steps for Development

1. **UI Improvements**

    - Add progress indicators during processing
    - Improve error messaging for users

2. **Performance Optimizations**

    - Optimize model loading time
    - Implement caching for processed results

3. **Feature Enhancements**

    - Add support for more resume formats
    - Implement batch processing for multiple candidates
    - Add candidate comparison visualization

4. **Security Enhancements**
    - Implement secure storage for candidate data
    - Add authentication for API access
