# PET - Performance Evaluation Tool

This is a project that combines Android app development with Python machine learning models for candidate evaluation during interviews. The project involves:

1. Video analysis to assess English speaking skills, fluency, and vocabulary
2. Resume parsing and analysis
3. CGPA evaluation
4. Integration of these features into a comprehensive evaluation system

The codebase uses:

-   Java/Kotlin for Android UI
-   Python for machine learning models
-   TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning
-   Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text analysis
-   OpenCV for video processing

When suggesting code, please consider:

-   Best practices for integrating Python ML models with Android applications
-   Efficient video processing techniques to work well on mobile devices
-   Secure handling of candidate data and evaluations
-   Modern Android UI design principles
